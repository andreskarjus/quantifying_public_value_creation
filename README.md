Code and data to reproduce the graphs and analysis in "Quantifying public value creation by public service media using big programming data" by Indrek Ibrus, Andres Karjus, Vejune Zemaityte, Ulrike Rohn, Maxilian Schich. To reproduce our graphs:

1. Unpack the quantifying_public_value_data.csv.zip - inside is a CSV file with a subset of the ERR data necessary to reproduce out analyses.
2. Open the quantifying_public_value_code.R file in an instance of R (we recommend using the RStudio IDE). Follow the instructions, including package installation and loading the data, in the header of this script file. Either place the CSV file and the quantifying_public_value_scripts.R file in the working directory of your R installation (run getwd() to see where), or provide full paths in the code file.
3. Run the code line by line to reproduce the analyses and graphs as they appear in the paper.
